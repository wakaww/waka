                Waka Worldwide is part of the arc of the Kingdom narrative that is centrally about reconciling all things to our creator, making right the injustices in the world, and restoring all of creation to health, beauty, and freedom. Our mission is firmly rooted and established in Christ and His love. During his time on earth, Jesus lived counter-culturally. He went to the darkest places, where no one else wanted to go. He sought out the hurting, the weak, and the poor. He attended to the people everyone else overlooked. He healed the man who had no one to help him into the healing pool in Bethesda. He shared meals with tax collectors, who were the most corrupt and deceptive parts of society. He turned the social order upside down.
                <br>
                <br>
                We are joining those who have gone before us as God’s people, compelled to follow in the footsteps of Jesus into places of brokenness. We are embodying Christ’s mission and ushering in His kingdom of righteousness, justice, and peace. And we are beginning where he began, among the fatherless, widows, sick, oppressed, and poor.

              We partner with local organizations, such as The Ark Uganda, a community-based organization in Lira, Uganda.

              <br>
              Lira, Uganda is an urban center in northern-Uganda, where years of civil war has destroyed the fabric of families and communities. From 1987 to 2005, the Lord’s Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony terrorized the Ugandan people. The LRA has been accused of human rights violations including murder, arson, abduction, rape, mutilation, child-sex slavery, and forcibly recruiting and training child soldiers. Many internally displaced persons and refugees sought safety by migrating to Lira and other towns. Fear paired with residual effects of war, such as extreme poverty and broken family relationships, continue to impact the community today. The Ark Uganda is a community-based organization that is currently meeting the needs of homeless youth and teenage mothers by providing access to basic needs – shelter, food, and medical care. Its vision is to love the street youth of Lira, Uganda by discipling them in Christ, providing for their basic needs and restoring them to their families. We join them in believing that by consistently coming together in worship, studying scriptures to help these kids to fully understand and find connection in Jesus, they will come to know that Jesus is everything they can ever need or want in spirit, soul, and body.
